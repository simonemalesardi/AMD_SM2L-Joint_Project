    "•  Fan-Out: This is when a large amount of cash is deposited into a bank account and then transferred to multiple accounts in different locations or jurisdictions https://bing.com/search?q=money+laundering+patterns. This makes it harder to trace the source and destination of the funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Fan-In: This is the opposite of fan-out. It is when multiple small deposits are made into different accounts and then consolidated into a single account https://baselgovernance.org/sites/default/files/2019-04/indicators_and_patterns_of_money_laundering_or_terrorist_financing.pdf. This makes it easier to move the funds without attracting attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Cycle: This is when funds are moved in a circular pattern among several accounts or entities, often using shell companies or offshore accounts https://bing.com/search?q=money+laundering+patterns. This creates confusion and obscures the audit trail of the funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Bipartite: This is when funds are transferred between two parties that have no apparent business relationship or legitimate reason for the transaction https://bing.com/search?q=money+laundering+patterns. This may indicate that the parties are colluding to launder money or evade taxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Stack: This is when funds are moved through several layers of transactions, often involving different financial institutions, intermediaries or instruments https://bing.com/search?q=money+laundering+patterns. This adds complexity and distance between the original source and the final destination of the funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Random: This is when funds are moved in an irregular or unpredictable manner, without any clear pattern or logic https://bing.com/search?q=money+laundering+patterns. This may indicate that the launderer is trying to avoid detection by creating noise or confusion in the transaction data.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Scatter Gather: This is when funds are split into smaller amounts and dispersed to multiple accounts or locations, and then reassembled into a larger amount at a different account or location https://bing.com/search?q=money+laundering+patterns. This makes it difficult to track the movement and ownership of the funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "•  Gather Scatter: This is the reverse of scatter gather. It is when funds are collected from multiple sources and aggregated into a larger amount, and then distributed to multiple destinations or beneficiaries https://bing.com/search?q=money+laundering+patterns. This makes it hard to identify the origin and purpose of the funds."
